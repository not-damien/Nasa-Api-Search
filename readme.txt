I used some of nasas API's
the first endpoint i used was 'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod' witch returns nasas Pic of the day or POD for short
when refreshed the page calls nasa's api and gets the url and info about the photo and applies it to an img element 
the other endpoitn i used was 'ttps://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos'
this api returns photos taken by the curousity rover by sol (i.e mars day 0-max)
