I used some of NASA's APIs
The first endpoint I used was 'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod' which returns NASA's Pic of the Day or POD for short.
When refreshed the page calls NASA's API and gets the URL and info about the photo and applies it to an img element. 
The other endpoint I used was 'ttps://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos'.
This API returns photos taken by the curiosity rover by sol (i.e Mars day 0-max).
